His works has appeared on well-established labels like Kagdilia Records, Yellow Sunshine Explosion, Ajana Records and Zealotry Music, and his music has brought him to play at parties like Full Moon Festival (Germany), VuuV Festival (Germany), Aurora Festival (Greece), Rhythms Of Peace Festival (Morocco), and Tribe of Frog (UK).</p><p>As a follower of psychedelic trance music and psychedelic trance parties since 1995, Thoke started DJ'ing and producing in 2002. Always with an open mind for both uplifting melodies and darker atmospheres - from chillout and ambient to progressive trance and darker psychedelic trance, although mostly with emphasis on the peaceful and harmonic effects of chillout.</p><p>«Before The Morning Sun» is a rich, colorful journey of mostly relaxing atmospheres, but also more dancefriendly grooves. From deep, melancholic and slowly evolving underwater soundscapes to uplifting, almost goatrance-like melodies and grooves inspired by progressive trance, house and breakbeat. This is an album to be enjoyed both in headphones on a clear summer-day, brightening up a cold winter morning, as well as dancing with your eyes closed. It really is a a truly diverse album, and it clearly shines through that Senzar has spent the last two years making it as personal and perfect as possible.</p><p>As an added bonus the album also contains remixes by two of Senzar's friends; progressive trance artist N.A.S.A., well-known for his releases on Iboga Records, Iono Music and many more labels, as well as the upcoming Danish artist Erot.</p>",

We are happy to introduce you with known projects and a new perspective names from our opinion ;) Hope you will enjoy it!</p><p>Time Loop:<br>A time loop or temporal loop is a common plot device in science fiction (especially in universes where time travel is commonplace) in which time runs normally for a set period (usually a day or a few hours) but then skips back like a broken record. When the time loop 'resets', the memories of most characters are reset (i.e. they forget all that happened). The plot is advanced, however, by having one or more central characters retain their memory or become aware of the loop through deja vu.</p><p>Beyond Borders:<br>Take a journey through universe with your Divine Essence breaking up all borders. Become the ray of light that trickle through your Reality. Spiritual awakening and discover new orbital's. Feel the freshness of alien atmosphere's and dive in to the deepness of space oceans. Take a walk the most mystical forests. Follow the white rabbits and blue bird. Find yourself in twisted reality.</p><p>Fascinating an inner journey into profound states of love, inspiration, spiritual meditation, and self-approval! Relax. Breathe deeply. Open your eyes!</p>",
